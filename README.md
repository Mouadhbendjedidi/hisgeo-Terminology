Welcome to a fun, effective, and organized way to study History and Geography terminology using the **spaced repetition** method!

This project is perfect for Algerian third-year secondary students looking to **boost their memory** and **study smarter, not harder**.

## ✨ Why This Exists

The idea came to me during my final year of high school. I discovered [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), an awesome flashcard app based on **spaced repetition**, and thought:  
**Why not apply this to our History and Geo terminology?**

After successfully using it myself, I decided to make the list available in digital format—first through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and later on, in Anki format (coming soon!).

> We count on you, programmers! 😆

## 📱 How to Use It (Phone or PC)

Right now, the terminology files are designed to work with **Obsidian**, a popular knowledge management app. It works great across **Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS**.

Later, I plan to release an Anki version too!
