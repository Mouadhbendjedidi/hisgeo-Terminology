# History and Geography Terminology for Third-Year Secondary Students! ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡¿

This resource contains all the information you need to memorize terminology in a fun way using the **spaced repetition** method!

## Where Did the Idea Come From?

The idea came to me at the beginning of my last high school year. I applied it using an app called [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), which specializes in creating "Flash Cards" based on **spaced repetition**. From there, I decided to share the terminology in a digital format (there might be some mistakes, so feel free to correct them by opening a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Mouadhbendjedidi/hisgeo-Terminology/pulls)).

We count on you, our programmers! ðŸ˜†

## How Can I Access This on My Phone or PC?

For now, I have formatted the terminology to work with a popular app among productivity enthusiasts and note-takers called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It works on all devices, whether it's a phone or a PC (don't worry, iPhone and Mac users, I havenâ€™t forgotten about you ðŸ˜†).

In the future, I plan to make the terminology available for **Anki** once everything is properly organized.

## The Process!

Follow these stepsâ€”it's a one-time setup!

## Creating a Vault in Obsidian

1. Open Obsidian and select **Create new vault**.

2. Choose a name for your vault and select a location to store it on your device.

3. Click **Create** to finalize the process.

For a more detailed tutorial, you can check [this guide](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Creating+your+vault).

## Installing and Enabling Community Plugins

1. Open **Settings** in Obsidian.

2. Navigate to **Community Plugins** and enable them by toggling the switch.
