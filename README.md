Welcome to a fun, effective, and organized way to study History and Geography terminology using the **spaced repetition** method!

This project is perfect for Algerian third-year secondary students looking to **boost their memory** and **study smarter, not harder**.

## ✨ Why This Exists

The idea came to me during my final year of high school. I discovered [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), an awesome flashcard app based on **spaced repetition**, and thought:  
**Why not apply this to our History and Geo terminology?**

After successfully using it myself, I decided to make the list available in digital format for everyone.
